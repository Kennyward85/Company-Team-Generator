# Team-Generator 
Creating a team profile generater using class constructors 



# How the program will Operate 
1:Will be using class constructors with inquirer to build a team that will be rendered to an html

2: Depedning on which Employee type is selected will change the questions asked

3:Manager will ask for : Office Number

4:Engineer: will ask for :Github

5:Intern: Will ask for School

6:These will all ask for the same basic questions before hand based off the Employee constructor

7:Once the team has been built the program will then have the option to select None to end and render the information to an HTML displaying the information
